Unlike other forms of betting, such as point spread betting or moneyline betting, 1X betting eliminates the need to predict the margin of victory or defeat. This can make 1X betting an attractive option for beginners or those who are new to sports betting, as it reduces the complexity of the betting process and allows bettors to focus on the outcome of the event itself.",

Additionally, the potential for a draw outcome means that 1X betting is inherently more unpredictable than other forms of betting, and as such, may carry a higher risk for the bettor.",
